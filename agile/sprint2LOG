In Sprint 2, I expanded my program to handle courses and grades. I added the ability to create and remove courses, enroll students into those courses, and assign grades to them. 
I also built a menu so the user can choose options like adding a course, adding a student, enrolling them, or giving them a grade. 
This made the program more complete compared to Sprint 1.
